# **🛠️ StudentHUB Installation Guide**  

## **Authored by The Architect (Abdulkadir Ahmed)**  

## **📌 Overview**  
This guide provides a high-level overview of how to set up and test the **StudentHUB** app.  

For **testing purposes**, only the **frontend** needs to be downloaded and set up. The **backend is already hosted remotely**, so API requests will function automatically.  

Additionally, an **APK file** is released for every version, allowing **manual installation for Android testing** if preferred.
