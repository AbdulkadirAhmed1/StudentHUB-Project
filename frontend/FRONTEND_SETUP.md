# **StudentHUB Frontend** üì±  

## **Authored by The Architect (Abdulkadir Ahmed)**  

This is the frontend of the StudentHUB project, built using React Native & Expo. You can test this by only downloading the frontend files; the backend is hosted separately and does not need to be set up locally. Additionally, an APK file is released for every version for Android testing, allowing you to manually download and install it if preferred. The next release will be Version 2.0 (2nd Generation).

## **üìå Setup & Run Instructions**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**  
Before running the project, install the required dependencies:  

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the App**  
Run the following command to start Expo:  

   ```bash

## **üí° Notes for TAs**  
- The app **requires scanning a QR code** using Expo Go for mobile testing.  
- For quick testing, the **web version (`w`) is available** but may have slight UI differences.  
- Backend APIs are hosted on **Render**, and the frontend fetches live data automatically.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the App on Your Device**  
After starting Expo, you'll see a terminal output with options to run the app:  
‚úÖ **Scan the QR Code** using **Expo Go** (for Android/iOS).  
‚úÖ **Press `w`** to open the app in a **web browser** (optional).  
‚úÖ **Run on an emulator/simulator** (if set up).
