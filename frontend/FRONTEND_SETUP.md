# **StudentHUB Frontend** üì±  

## **Authored by The Architect (Abdulkadir Ahmed)**  

This is the frontend of the StudentHUB project, built using React Native & Expo. You can test this by simply downloading the frontend files; the backend is hosted separately and does not need to be set up locally. Additionally, an APK file is released for every version for Android testing, allowing you to manually download and install it if preferred. The next release will be Version 2(V2) (2nd Generation).

### **‚öôÔ∏è "Compile & Run" Standard (The simply way to test this product)**  
This project follows a **simple setup process** that aligns with standard **"Compile & Run" expectations**:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the repository**  with `git clone https://github.com/AbdulkadirAhmed1/StudentHUB-Project.git`

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install dependencies** with `npm install`  [Install Node.js(LTS) for the npm command](https://nodejs.org/en)

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Start the Expo server** with `npx expo start`  [Install Node.js(LTS) for the npx command](https://nodejs.org/en)

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the app** via QR code, web, or emulator  

## **üí° Notes for Reviewers & Testers**  
- The app **requires scanning a QR code** using Expo Go for mobile testing.  
- For quick testing, the **web version (`w`) is available** but will have UI differences (based on generation of the project).  
- Backend APIs are hosted on **Render**, and the frontend fetches live data automatically.
- 
### **üåê Web Testing and Desktop App Option (As of generation 1 (V1)**  
If you prefer **not to test the mobile app**, you can simply run the project in a **web browser** (`w`).  

‚úÖ The web version is functional, but **note that this project is primarily designed for mobile (based on the current generation 1 (V1))**.
  
‚úÖ The **frontend is planned to be hosted in the future(as of v3.0 generation)**, allowing users to access the **web version without local setup**.  

‚úÖ A **dedicated website version(as of V3 3rd generation)** will receive **its own specific development soon**, separate from the mobile-first approach. 

‚úÖ A **desktop application(as of V4 4th generation) is planned for future releases**.
