### Log 1.11 ‚Äì 5/15/2025

- **Empty Calendar State**  
  - When the screen first loads, no date is highlighted and the bottom card shows a large ‚ÄúSelect a date‚Äù placeholder in gray italic text.  
  - The ‚Äú+ Add Course‚Äù button is visible but adding is disabled until a date is chosen.  
  - This ensures users understand they must pick a date before scheduling classes.  
  - ![No Date Selected](https://i.imgur.com/vGvf4FV.png)

- **Empty Date State**  
  - Tapping any calendar cell updates the card header to the chosen date (e.g. ‚Äú8 March 2024‚Äù).  
  - If that date has no courses, the card shows a centered ‚ÄúNo courses scheduled‚Äù message in the same gray italic style.  
  - The ‚Äú+ Add Course‚Äù button remains active, guiding the next action.  
  - ![Date Selected, No Courses](https://i.imgur.com/l8oi9im.png)

- **Add Course Interaction**  
  - Pressing ‚Äú+ Add Course‚Äù slides up a translucent modal overlay.  
  - The top row includes a department picker (fetched from `/api/departments`) and a live‚Äêfilter search bar.  
  - Typing into the search field filters the course list in real time, matching course codes (case-insensitive).  
  - Selecting a course closes the modal and schedules it on the current date.  
  - ![Add Course Button View](https://i.imgur.com/XdaCwQc.png)

- **Single Course Scheduled**  
  - After scheduling one course (e.g. EECS1010 at 9:00 AM), the bottom card displays a single rounded badge.  
  - Badge styling: dark gray background (`#2C2C2C`), white text, borderRadius 12px, padding 6px vertical.  
  - The card remains scrollable but does not scroll for a single item.  
  - ![One Course Added](https://i.imgur.com/MTE3iwV.png)

- **Multiple Courses Scheduled**  
  - Scheduling additional courses (e.g. EECS1045 at 10:30 AM, EECS1720 at 2:30 PM) adds more badges in chronological order by time.  
  - The card‚Äôs ScrollView becomes active, allowing vertical scrolling when badges exceed available space.  
  - Each badge now includes three lines:  
    1. **Course:** `<code>`  
    2. **Time:** `<formatted time>` (e.g. 2:30 PM)  
    3. **Prof:** `<name or N/A>`  
    4. A **View Pre-Reqs** button opens the prerequisites modal.  
  - ![Three Courses Added](https://i.imgur.com/jhCvpHR.png)

- **Dot Indicator on Calendar**  
  - Dates with at least one scheduled course display a small blue dot under the day number (`#00A3FF`, 6√ó6px circle).  

- **Prerequisite Modal**  
  - Tapping **View Pre-Reqs** opens a separate modal showing nested OR/AND chains as bullet lists.  
  - Example rendering for EECS2030:  
    - ‚Ä¢ EECS1021 OR EECS1020 OR EECS1022 OR EECS1720  
    - AND ‚Ä¢ EECS1045  
  - This helps students verify eligibility before enrolling.  
  - ![Pre-Req Button](https://i.imgur.com/6D4ePuT.png)

- **Design & Layout Notes**  
  - **Bottom Card** uses a `flex-start` layout with a header row (`date` centered, button right-aligned via `marginLeft: 'auto'`).  
  - Card height grows to fit content up to 50% of screen height, then scrolls.  
  - Badges are centered (`alignItems: 'center'`), fixed at 90% of card width, and stacked with vertical margin.  
  - Calendar grid removed selection when navigating months to avoid carrying over the same day into new month.  
  - Consistent dark theme (`#181818` background, `#1E1E1E` cards), white text, subtle gray accents, and rounded corners (8‚Äì20px) deliver a modern, accessible UI.

*This release completes the Calendar‚Äôs scheduling flow, from empty states through multi-course management and prerequisite inspection.*

### Log 1.12 ‚Äì 8/25/2025

This entry represents several weeks of progress across the frontend. Since the previous log (1.11), we have moved from feature prototyping into a phase of **refinement, modularization, and design polish**. This is the longest entry so far because it consolidates multiple iterations: the deep restructuring of the Calendar feature, persistent data storage per user, and the complete design and implementation of the Profile page. It‚Äôs equivalent to multiple dev logs merged into one.

---

- **Calendar Modularization & Enhancements (Post-Log 1.11)**
  - After scheduling, prerequisite checking, and duplicate detection were introduced in **Log 1.11**, it became clear that `calendar.tsx` was doing far too much. All logic ‚Äî header, date grid, modals, course rendering, prereq handling ‚Äî lived in one file. This made iteration slow and error-prone.
  - We decided to **modularize**. Every responsibility was broken into its own dedicated component. This was one of the most important structural changes in the frontend to date.
  - **Component Breakdown**
    - `CalendarHeader.tsx` ‚Üí Displays the current month and year with left/right arrows. Now it only worries about navigation (prev/next month). Nothing else.
    - `CalendarGrid.tsx` ‚Üí Responsible for laying out weeks and days. It knows about selection states, out-of-month cells, and whether a date should have an ‚Äúevent dot‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt touch modals or course logic.
    - `ScheduledCoursesCard.tsx` ‚Üí Shows the list of courses for the currently selected day. Independent scrolling, empty state messaging, ‚Äú+ Add Course‚Äù button. Clean separation of the presentation layer.
    - `AddCourseModal.tsx` ‚Üí Handles course fetching and filtering. It talks to the backend for departments and courses, applies search filters, and lets the user pick. Then it returns the selected course upward. Isolated, so it could be reused in Advising or Group Chat in the future.
    - `PrereqModal.tsx` ‚Üí Dedicated UI for prerequisites. Formats AND/OR prereqs into human-readable bullet points. Clean and simple.
  - **Why Modularization Matters**
    - Before: `calendar.tsx` was 500+ lines of mixed logic.  
      After: a set of smaller, testable, swappable components.
    - Each component is single-purpose, making testing, debugging, and future enhancements much easier.
    - Clear separation of concerns means design changes (like styling the header differently) no longer risk breaking scheduling logic.
    - Scalability is now built-in: future features like exporting schedules, reminders, or switching to weekly view will be additions, not rewrites.
  - **UX & Feature Refinements**
    - Improved sorting: Courses are automatically ordered by time.
    - Duplicate prevention: Users cannot add the same course twice.
    - Time conflict detection: Friendly alerts prevent double-booking.
    - Per-user persistence: Courses are stored under `calendar_<username>` in AsyncStorage. Logging in as another student loads a completely separate schedule.
    - Visual polish: Event dots beneath day numbers give students quick awareness of busy days.
  - **Design & Philosophy**
    - The calendar now feels like an actual ‚Äústudent planner,‚Äù not just a prototype. Its dark theme matches the rest of the app, with layered grays for depth.
    - Empty states guide the user: instead of showing nothing, the card explains that courses will appear once added.
    - Every step is student-centered: feedback is immediate, data is consistent, and UI flows naturally.

---

- **Profile Page Implementation & Enhancements**
  - The Profile Page was created from scratch to give StudentHub users a sense of identity within the app. Instead of dumping user data inside the tabs (previously just `index.tsx`), we built a **dedicated route** and **modular components**. 
  
  ![Early Profile Look](https://i.imgur.com/6Oiiycz.png)
  
  - **Component Breakdown**
    - `ProfileHeader.tsx` ‚Üí A custom header where the focus is on the ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù title. The back arrow and settings icon are intentionally smaller and lighter gray to reduce visual dominance. Both are animated with Reanimated spring effects, providing tactile bounce feedback.
    - `ProfileAvatar.tsx` ‚Üí A circular avatar with a default person icon and a pencil overlay for editing. Pressing it triggers a spring bounce animation, making it feel like a real interactive control. The yellow accent ties into the app‚Äôs branding.
    - `ProfileInfo.tsx` ‚Üí Loads actual student data from AsyncStorage (`username`, `department`, `major`, `year of study`). Redirects to login if missing. Typography hierarchy: big bold username, small gray details. Matches modern mobile UI standards.
  - **Styling Enhancements**
    - Background: gradient from `#2C2C2C` to `#000000`, matching the login screen for visual consistency.
    - Spacing: rebalanced so that header, avatar, and info feel aligned and centered, not cramped or pushed down.
    - Typography: cleaner fonts, bigger profile title, lighter details. A clear visual hierarchy where the most important data pops first.
  - **Animations**
    - Avatar bounce ‚Üí immediate feedback when touched.
    - Back arrow and settings ‚Üí smaller but consistent bounce animation.
    - Planned: fade-in or slide animations for the profile title itself.
  - **Impact**
    - The profile page now feels like a real app feature, not an afterthought. It demonstrates how modularization plus animation plus styling can elevate a screen from basic to polished.
    - Sets the groundwork for next steps: Edit Profile, Reset Password, Logout, and Settings, all of which will plug into the modular system easily.

- **Previous Commits**
  - **Aug 19, 2025**: `feat(calendar): save and load courses with AsyncStorage, linked to logged-in user`  
    - A crucial step in persistence. Each user now has a personal calendar state. This required restructuring AsyncStorage keys and ensuring the calendar loads correctly on mount. Without this, the calendar would be generic across all logins.
    - This commit bridged authentication with scheduling, creating a truly personalized planner.
  - **Aug 18, 2025**: `Added courses ordered by date and duplicate validation`  
    - Critical for UX. Before this, courses could appear unordered, or worse, duplicated. Students might have thought the app was buggy or unreliable.
    - By enforcing order and preventing duplicates, the calendar became reliable. Students trust that what they see is accurate.
    - Marked the shift from prototype features to production-quality constraints.

---

- **Overall Progress**
  - **Cohesive Flow**: Students now experience a connected journey: Login ‚Üí Calendar ‚Üí Profile. Each screen uses gradients, dark mode, yellow accents, and interactive feedback.
  - **Consistency Across Modules**
    - Calendar: modular, persistent, and student-focused.
    - Profile: modular, animated, and identity-focused.
    - Login: already gradient-based, now visually matched by Profile.
  - **Scalability**
    - Calendar: ready for filters, exports, reminders, multi-view layouts.
    - Profile: ready for editing, settings, logout, even profile pictures in the future.
  - **Design Language**
    - Unified dark aesthetic with layered contrasts.
    - Yellow as the accent color (edit icons, highlights).
    - Animation as a standard: every important control responds.
  - **Philosophy**
    - Build modularly, so nothing is stuck as ‚Äújust one big file.‚Äù
    - Build with the student in mind: clarity, feedback, persistence.
    - Build for tomorrow: these components are not one-offs; they are designed to evolve.

- **Planned Work**
  - Upcoming improvements will focus on **dynamic animations** across the app to make navigation feel smoother and more immersive.  
  - The bottom navigation bar is planned to get animated feedback when switching tabs, reinforcing interactivity.  
  - The calendar will also receive animated transitions between months and days, helping students visually track changes instead of abrupt jumps.

*This log consolidates several weeks of work since Log 1.11. It documents the transformation of the Calendar into a modular, persistent, and user-friendly planner, alongside the creation of a polished, animated Profile Page. Together, these changes push StudentHub closer to a production-ready app. This entry is intentionally long ‚Äî three logs‚Äô worth of updates ‚Äî to reflect the depth and breadth of the progress made during this period.*
