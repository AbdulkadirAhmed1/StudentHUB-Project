   - Fields include Username, Password, Year of Study, and Program.
   - **Reproduction:**
     - First, try leaving fields empty to trigger validation errors.
     - Then, fill in valid details (e.g., Username: 6‚Äì10 characters, Password: 5‚Äì15 characters, Year of Study: 1‚Äì10, Program: 6‚Äì10 characters).
     - Tap "Register" (using the yellow gradient button) and ensure you are automatically logged in (redirected to Calendar/Profile).
     - Tap "Cancel" to return to the Login screen if needed.

5. **Profile/Calendar View:**
   - Upon successful login or registration, verify that the app routes to the Profile (formerly Home) page.
   - Confirm that the Profile page shows a dark, modern look consistent with the gradient background and clean typography.

6. **General UI/UX Checks:**
   - All input fields and buttons should be clearly spaced with the updated margins:
     - Increased spacing between inputs and between the "Forgot Password?", Login, and Sign up buttons.
   - The overall color scheme is unified with the dark background and yellow gradient accents (reflecting the logo‚Äôs colors).
   - Ensure that the icons, text, and gradients render correctly across devices.
  
7. **Run Jest Unit Tests** (Ensure test cases pass in components>tests):
