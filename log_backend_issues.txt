 Backend Issues Log 

 Updates:
- Integrated API calls to fetch/send messages.
- UI layout improvements for smoother rendering.
- Connected backend to PostgreSQL.

Encountered Issues:
- Backend not responding at: http://localhost:5000/api/chat/messages
- Error message: "curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 5000"
- PostgreSQL connection verified manually via `psql`, but API calls fail.
- `netstat` does not show the server listening on port `5000`.

 Debugging Attempts:
1. Restarted PostgreSQL (`net stop postgresql-x64-17 && net start postgresql-x64-17`).
2. Disabled and re-enabled firewall (`netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off`).
3. Checked Node.js server logs (`npm run dev` confirmed running).
4. Switched backend to port `4000` (did not resolve the issue).
5. Verified database connection via `psql -U postgres -d studenthub` (working).

 Possible Causes:
- Port `5000` may be blocked by another process.
- Express.js not binding correctly to `localhost`.
- Windows network settings preventing connections.
